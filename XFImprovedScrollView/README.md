An improved ScrollView for Xamarin Forms: BloopyScrollView
==============

Bouncy Effect - Yeah you gotta admit, the bounce effect of a native scrollview is pretty fun to play with, in a User's perspective. So I thought of enabling this feature in my custom ScrollView even when the Child Element doesn't exceeds the ScrollView boundaries... ;)
(PS: this effect is interpreted in native Android and iOS differently)

Disabling and Enabling Horizontal and Vertical Scroll Indicators - Now sometimes these scroll bar indicators are useful but there are times which we want to hide them, as it might look ugly on the UI in certain cases. So yeah let's have some control over it shall we? :D

Background Image - Of course who wouldn't like a background Image on a Scroll view eh! ;) Well to be specific we are going to add a Fixed Background Image for the ScrollView. And note that this background Image would be fixed, and will not be scrolling with the Content of the ScrollView.

Yes behold, me, myself and I presenting the "BloopyScrollView" why the name "BloopyScrollView"? I don't even know. lol :P
