A Transparent Popup Page for Xamarin Forms (Updated & Fixed Solution)
==============

This is a transparent popup page which can be used as a Modal Page to render a transparent page background built on Xamarin Forms.
Where this implementation could be used for any transparent popups, such as Loading screens, Dialog boxes and so on.
Since the latest Xamarin update broke my previous solution(https://github.com/UdaraAlwis/Xamarin-Playground/tree/master/XFTransparentPopup)
Here is the updated solution with a new approach for creating Transparent Pages in Xamarin Forms with the help of Rg.Plugins.Popup library!
