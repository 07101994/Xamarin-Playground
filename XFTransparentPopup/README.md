A Transparent Popup Page for Xamarin Forms
==============

This is a popup page inherited from default Xamarin Forms Content Page, which can be used as a Modal Page to render a transparent page background.
Where this implementation could be used for any transparent popups, such as Loading screens, Dialog boxes and so on.

IMPORTANT UPDATE:
--------------
Since I updated my Xamarin installation on local pc and this solution, the transparent effect doesn't seem to be working as it used to be. Although the reason doesn't seem to make sense, I will find a workaround for this ASAP! stay tuned!

I have published the updated solution right here: https://github.com/UdaraAlwis/Xamarin-Playground/tree/master/XFTransparentPopupUpdate
